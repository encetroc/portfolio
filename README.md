</p>  

This project is about making my personal portfolio to showcase projects I make.  
You can use it for your own personal portfolio if you want to.  
It is made using only HTML, CSS and Javascript, I used Parcel to minify and bundle the project and Netlify to deploy it.  
The portfolio contains the following features:  
- Logo
- Fullscreen navigation
- Introduction section
- Skills section with cards
- About-me section
- Projects section, with cards
- Footer, with icon links
- Fully responsive
## How to use
Clone the project to your machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/encetroc/portfolio.git
